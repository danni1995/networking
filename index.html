        <h2>HTTP</h2>
        <p>
          HTTP stands for "Hyper text transport protocol" and is used to make
          web browsers communicate with web servers. When you enter a website it
          always begins with "http://" and then the name of the website. When
          people are browsing the internet or a specific website they are
          constantly sending information across the internet to the server. When
          a person puts their information on a website for example their name,
          phone number, address or credit card information all that information
          has to be transferred across the internet to the server. This makes it
          easy for "hackers" to get a hold of their information. And this is
          where HTTPS is introduced.
        </p>
        <h2>HTTPS</h2>
        <p>
          Https stands for "Hyer text transport secure" and as you might see
          from the name it's a secure way for information to cross the internet
          so noone can grab and steal your information. Https is a multi layer
          encryption security system that encrypts all sensitive data that
          people might enter on a website. All major websites like facebook,
          youtube for example are using https even though you are just browsing
          the website And not entering information about yourself, this has
          become a lot more coomon since google has added a "secure" and "not
          secure" icon when you search or enter a website and therefore websites
          that are don't have https are not as likely to turn up on top when
          searching on google.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="DNS">
        <h2>DNS</h2>
        <p>
          DNS stands for "Domain name system" and is a way for your computer to
          get IP addresses from servers. Lets take an example: You type in your
          browser a domain name like www.myspace.com and then the browser sends
          that request to the server asking it for the IP address for
          "myspace.com". The servers dosen't recognize "myspace.com" because
          Computers talk together in numbers. That's where the DNS server comes
          in play, he can find the assigned IP address to the domain name and
          send that information back to your computer, makes sense?

      <div class="web-hosting">
        <h2>Web-Hosting & Cloud computing</h2>
        <p>
          For you to have a website on the internet you have to host it on a
          server somewhere. You do this by buying a host server from a company
          that hosts. The server is a physical device somewhere that has your
          website and all the other websites together on the same server. This
          can be a good thing cause the payment cost is low since you share the
          server with a lot of other people but if can be a bit of a hassle.
          Lets say you have a website on a server with 500 other webistes and
          one of the websites that you share a server with gains a huge
          following, that can effect your website connection to the server since
          it will be under a lot of load and it can slow down the connection.
          That's where Cloud computing comes in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cloud computing is very similar to web hosting but instead of having
          websites on one server the website is spanned across multiple servers.
          So your website can be located on 10,15 or 20 servers so that the load
          is split across servers and makes it much more scaleable.
        </p>

      <div class="caching">
        <h2>Caching</h2>
        <p>
          When you go to a website the client (your browser) sends a request to
          the server, the server analizes the data and sends a response, just
          like we talked about earlier in this article. Now lets say you enter
          this website again, then the server takes the request and analizes the
          data and sends the response again. This can be a lot of unessarary
          work for the server and that's where "caching" enters the chat.
          Caching saves the request data so that when the server gets that
          request from your client it knows "oh okay, I have this saved here"
          and doesn't have to do all the analizing all over again. This can
          prevent the server from crashing especially if there are a lot of
          request coming in and this makes the user experience better since they
          can get their responses faster.
        </p>

      <div class="TCP">
        <h2>TCP/IP</h2>
        <p>
          TCP stands for "Transmisson control protocol" and IP stands for
          "Internet Protocol" and they specifies how devices should communicate
          with eachother over the internet. These protocols decide how data
          should be transmitted and essentially broken down and distriputed over
          the internet.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="static">
        <h2>Static/Dynamic Websites</h2>
        <p>Static websites consists of html, css and javascript. A static website can 
            have only html and css, it does not have to contain all three, but no more than
            these three and the site is made of javascript but not for example node.js. To
             understand static website better lets say you make a basic website
            with these three indexes, html, css and javascript. The website is hosted on a server
            and when a user makes a request on the page the source code does not change based on the 
            request we made. The only way for the static website to change is if the code is 
            changed manually by someone. Dynamic websites are made with systems like droople,
             node.js or wordpress or many other. That system will handle the request you make and 
             generate the page for you.
